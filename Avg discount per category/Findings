Variability in Discount Levels: 
The average discount percentages vary significantly across different categories, ranging from 0% to as high as 90%. 
This indicates that discounting strategies vary widely depending on the product category and market conditions.

Electronics Categories: Several electronics categories, such as "Electronics|Mobiles&Accessories|MobileAccessories|Stands" and "Electronics|Headphones,Earbuds&Accessories|Adapters," have relatively high average discount percentages (above 60%). 
This suggests that these categories may be highly competitive, with frequent promotions and discounts aimed at attracting customers.

Home & Kitchen Categories: Categories related to home and kitchen appliances, such as "Home&Kitchen|Heating,Cooling&AirQuality|Humidifiers" and "Home&Kitchen|Kitchen&HomeAppliances|SmallKitchenAppliances|Juicers," have moderate average discount percentages (around 30%-50%). 
These categories may see occasional promotions but not as frequently as highly competitive electronics categories.

Low Discount Categories: Some categories, such as "Home&Kitchen|CraftMaterials|PaintingMaterials" and "Electronics|Cameras&Photography|MediaStreamingDevices|StreamingClients," have an average discount percentage of 0%. 
This suggests that products in these categories are less frequently discounted, possibly due to higher perceived value or lower competition.

Outliers: There are a few categories with exceptionally high average discount percentages, such as "Computers&Accessories|Accessories&Peripherals|InternalHardDrives" (80%) and "Home&Kitchen|CraftMaterials|Scrapbooking|Tape" (90%).
These outliers may indicate specific marketing strategies or seasonal items.
